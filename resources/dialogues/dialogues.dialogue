#{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Good morning, Sir Guzman! 
#Sir Guzman: Good morning! Welcome to Cavite State University. 
#Sir Guzman: Here in the university, the Pollution Control Office diligently enforces CvSU Environmental Policies.
#Sir Guzman: These policies contribute to making the university a sustainable and eco-friendly haven.
#Sir Guzman: In this journey, everyone needs to play their part in preserving our environment and ensuring a vibrant campus life. So, gear up for a fulfilling adventure!
#{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Thanks for the warm welcome! I'm ready for the adventure.
#Sir Guzman: Fantastic! Before we dive in, let me emphasize the importance of waste collection on our campus.
#Sir Guzman: Proper waste management not only maintains the beauty of our surroundings but also plays a crucial role in our commitment to sustainability.
#Sir Guzman: Now, here's your first task: I need you to collect 10 recyclables. It's a small step, but it makes a big difference. Head to the designated areas, and let's make our campus cleaner and greener together!

{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Hi Sir Guard what happen to you?
Sir Guzman: [do dialogue_response_handler.respond("sad_expression", false)]Hello, I need your help. Can you help me?
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Of course, what is it?
Sir Guzman: [do dialogue_response_handler.respond("idle_expression", false)] I am monitoring the students entering our school for security purposes. However, I have noticed some [b]recyclable waste material[/b] around the area. 
Sir Guzman: Could you please pick it up to ensure our school remains clean and
welcoming?
Sir Guzman: Remember, [b]Proper waste management[/b] not only maintains the beauty of our surroundings but also [b]plays a crucial role in our commitment to sustainability[/b]. 
Sir Guzman: By [b]recycling[/b], we contribute to environmental sustainability by minimizing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions associated with manufacturing processes. 
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: I’m very excited to do this. 
Sir Guzman: Thank you, this is a very challenging task. Please think carefully about it. Good luck. 
Sir Guzman: Because there are [b]disobedient students[/b] who just throw their trash anywhere, such as on elevated places and in corners. 
Sir Guzman: Don’t forget to comeback to me after you collected all recyclable waste material.

ProfessorCruz: Good day! Welcome to the College of Nursing. 
ProfessorCruz: You know, here at [b]Cavite State University[/b], we're all about learning andkeeping things tidy. 
ProfessorCruz: Lately, we've been facing an issue with plastic waste piling up around campus, despite the [b]campus-wide ban on plastic[/b]. 
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: I see. How can I help?
ProfessorCruz: Glad you're on board! So, here's the deal: I need your help picking up non- biodegradable waste. You know, stuff like [b]PLASTIC BAGS[/b] and [b]JUICEBOX[/b] that don't break down easily. 
ProfessorCruz: If you can collect [b]10 pieces[/b] of this junk scattered around, it'll make a huge difference to our school's vibe. 
ProfessorCruz: Think you're up for the challenge?

{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Conservation? Like protecting theenvironment?
Luna: Exactly. And i have a special challenge for you. You see, our school is tryingtobe more environmentally friendly, and one way we can do that is by [b]conservingwater[/b] and [b]electricity[/b]. 
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: How can i help with that?
Luna: I'm glad you asked. I've noticed that [b]many students forget to turn off thefaucets after using them[/b] and [b]leave the lights on[/b] even in the middle of theday in certain areas of the school. So, I want you to help me by identifying thoseareas and reminding everyone to turn off the faucets and lights when they're not inuse. 
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: That sounds like great idea! I’min. Imexcited to take on this challenge and help make our school more eco-friendly. Luna: I knew i could count on you, get back to me when you're done. Remember, safety first. Take your time and be careful.

Sir Grayson: Good morning, Ready for another day of environmental studies?
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Good morning, Teacher! Absolutely, I'm excited to learn more. 
Sir Grayson: Fantastic! Before we dive into today's task, let's discuss how to identify
[b]biodegradable materials[/b]. It's important to know what to look for when seekingout environmentally friendly products. 
Sir Grayson: First, keep an eye out for certifications like the [b]"compostable"[/b] label. This indicates that the item is designed to break down quickly and safely in composting facilities. 
Sir Grayson: Second, look for materials like [b]PLA[/b] (polylactic acid) or plant-basedplastics. These materials are derived from renewable resources and are known tobiodegrade under the right conditions.
Sir Grayson: Lastly, consider the item's natural properties. Organic materials like paper, wood, and certain food scraps (such as fruit peels) are biodegradable by nature andbreak down over time. 
Sir Grayson: Now that you know what to look for, I have a task for you. I want you totake a stroll around our campus and find two biodegradable items. 
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Sure thing, Teacher. I'll keep thosetipsin mind as I explore the campus. 
Sir Grayson: Apply what you've learned about identifying biodegradable materials, andsee what you can find. If you can collect 10 pieces of this junk scattered around, it'll make a huge difference to our school's. 
Sir Grayson: Remember, identifying biodegradable items is essential for reducing our environmental impact. Your commitment to environmental awareness is commendable. Carry on, and let's strive for a more sustainable future together.

Zilong: Hey , ever wonder how to identify non-biodegradable items?
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Yeah, i need help for that because im not sure how to tell.

Zilong: Well, juice box is also non-biodegradable because juice box typically made of combination of materials like paper, plastic, and aluminum foil.
Zilong: While the paper portion may be biodegradable, but the plastic and foil are not.
