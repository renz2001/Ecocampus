Professor Cruz: Good day! Welcome to the College of Nursing.
Professor Cruz: You know, here at Cavite State University, we're all about learning and keeping things tidy.
Professor Cruz: But lately, we've got a bit of a problem with trash piling up around campus.
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: I see. How can I help?
Professor Cruz: Glad you're on board! So, here's the deal: I need your help picking up non-biodegradable waste. You know, stuff like PLASTIC BAGS and CUPS that don't break down easily.
Professor Cruz: If you can collect 10 pieces of this junk scattered around, it'll make a huge difference to our school's vibe.
Professor Cruz: Think you're up for the challenge?
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Absolutely! I'll get right on it, Professor.

{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Good day teacher!
Professor Luna: Good day my dear student.
Professor Luna: I want to talk about something very important “CONSERVATION”.
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Conservation? Like protecting the environment?
Professor Luna: Exactly. And i have a special challenge for you. You see, our school is trying to be more environmentally friendly, and one way we can do that is by conserving water and electricity.
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: How can i help with that?
Professor Luna: I'm glad you asked. I've noticed that many students forget to turn off the faucets after using them and leave the lights on even in the middle of the day in certain areas of the school. So, I want you to help me by identifying those areas and reminding everyone to turn off the faucets and lights when they're not in use.
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: That sounds like great idea! I’m in. Im excited to take on this challenge and help make our school more eco-friendly.
Professor Luna: I knew i could count on you, get back to me when you're done. Remember, safety first. Take your time and be careful.

Professor Grayson:  Good morning, Ready for another day of environmental studies?
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Good morning, Professor Grayson! Absolutely, I'm excited to learn more.
Professor Grayson: Fantastic! Before we dive into today's task, let's discuss how to identify biodegradable items. It's important to know what to look for when seeking out environmentally friendly products.
Professor Grayson: First, keep an eye out for certifications like the "compostable" label. This indicates that the item is designed to break down quickly and safely in composting facilities.
Professor Grayson: Second, look for materials like PLA (polylactic acid) or plant-based plastics. These materials are derived from renewable resources and are known to biodegrade under the right conditions.
Professor Grayson: Lastly, consider the item's natural properties. Organic materials like paper, wood, and certain food scraps (such as fruit peels) are biodegradable by nature and break down over time.
Professor Grayson: Now that you know what to look for, I have a task for you. I want you to take a stroll around our campus and find two biodegradable items. 
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Sure thing, Professor Grayson. I'll keep those tips in mind as I explore the campus.
Professor Grayson: Apply what you've learned about identifying biodegradable materials, and see what you can find. If you can collect 10 pieces of this junk scattered around, it'll make a huge difference to our school's
Professor Grayson: Remember, identifying biodegradable items is essential for reducing our environmental impact. Your commitment to environmental awareness is commendable. Carry on, and let's strive for a more sustainable future together.

Doctor Madrigal: Good day my dear student.
Doctor Madrigal: Just the person i was looking for.
Doctor Madrigal: I have challenge for you. As you know, our school is committed to sustainability, and one area where we can improve is waste disposal. 
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Waste disposal? How can i help with that?
Doctor Madrigal: Im glad you asked. I want you to lead an initiative to properly sort waste into designated bins for recyclable, biodegradable and non-biodegradable, but not everyone knows which items go where.
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: That sounds like a great idea! I’ll make sure to educate everyone on the proper sorting of waste. 
Doctor Madrigal: And don’t forget to lead by example. Make sure you’re sorting your own waste properly too.
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Of course! I’ll do my best to set a good example for everyone else.
Doctor Madrigal: I have faith in you. I’m confident we can make our school a cleaner and more sustainable place.

Bea: Hey, ever wonder how to tell if something’s recyclable?
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Definitely! It’s kind of confusing.
Bea: Well if it is Cans and Plastic. Cans are made of aluminum, which can be melted down and reused to make a new cans, saving energy and resources.
Bea: Plastic, on the other hand, can be recycled into various products, reducing the need for new plastic production and cutting down on pollution.
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Wow, i didn’t know that! Thanks for the information.
Bea: No problem! it’s all about giving theses materials a second life and helping the environment. Keep up the good work! and help our campus green!

~ zilong
Zilong: Hey , ever wonder how to identify non-biodegradable items?
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Yeah, i need help for that because im not sure how to tell.
Zilong: One way to check the material. Non-biodegradable items like plastics, metals and certain types of glass don’t break down naturally in the environment. They often have a shiny or synthetic appearance, unlike organic materials.
Zilong: Well, juice box is also non-biodegradable because juice box typically made of combination of materials like paper, plastic, and aluminum foil.
Zilong: While the paper portion may be biodegradable, but the plastic and foil are not.
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Ah, I see. Thank you for the information.
Zilong: No problem! Help our school to clean and green.

~ annie
Annie: Hey, ever wonder how to identify biodegradable items?
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Yeah, I'm not sure what to look for.
Annie: Well, biodegradable items are made from natural materials that can break down over time in the environment, like banana peels made from organic matter and coffee cups lined with compostable materials.
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Ah, so if it's made from natural stuff, it's probably biodegradable.
Annie: Exactly! By recognizing these materials, you can compost them instead of sending them to landfills, helping to return nutrients to the soil.
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Got it, thanks for the info!

~ viktor
Viktor: Hey there! Ready to learn about waste segregation?
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Sure, lay it on me!
Viktor: Alright, it's pretty simple. First off, we've got recyclables. That includes stuff like paper, plastic, and cans. They're materials that can be turned into new products.
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Got it, recyclables.
Viktor: Next up, we've got biodegradables. These are organic materials that break down naturally, like food scraps and yard waste.
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Okay, biodegradables. What about the last category?
Viktor: Non-biodegradables. These are materials that don't break down easily, like plastics, metals, and certain types of glass.
{{PlayerManager.player.data.custom_name}}: Gotcha, so recyclables, biodegradables, and non-biodegradables. Thanks for the info!
Viktor: No problem! Happy sorting!
